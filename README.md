# python-turtle-race

This is a Udemy project on creating multiple objects in the class of Turtle.

My solution provides a different approach wherein:
1. The y-positions that each turtle starts with takes into account the screen height, and divides it equally
2. The winning turtle colour is prompted on the screen by a new Turtle objet called "pen".
   Pen will indicate the winning turtle colour if you didn't choose the correct colour.

After viewing the Udemy solution, the change_shape and change_colour can be integrated into one function, which
is a much better solution! But for purposes of preserving my initial thought process, I have kept it as is.
